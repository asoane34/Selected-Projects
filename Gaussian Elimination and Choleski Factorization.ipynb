Firstly, given an $n\\:x\\:n$ matrix $A$ that is upper triangular, if $n=2$, we know that: $$det(A) = det\\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}\\\\0&a_{22}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}*0 = a_{11}a_{22}$$ As this clearly holds true in the $n = 2$ case, let us now assume that this holds true in the $n\\:x\\:n$ case and prove that this means it holds true in the $(n+1)\\:x\\:(n+1)$ case. Given an $(n+1)\\:x\\:(n+1)$ upper triangular matrix, we can calculate the determinant using cofactor expansion on the first column (had we done the proof with a lower triangular matrix, we would have simply used the first row instead of the first column). This yields the following: $$det(A) = (-1)^{1+1}a_{11}\\begin{bmatrix}a_{22}&\\cdot&\\cdot&a_{2(n+1)}\\\\0&a_{33}&\\cdot&a_{3(n+1)}\\\\\\cdot&\\cdot&\\cdot&\\cdot\\\\0&0&\\cdot&a_{(n+1)(n+1)}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}+ \\:0\\: +\\: ...\\: +\\: 0$$ The subsequent terms in the cofactor expansion using the first column will all equal zero because $a_{21} = a_{31} =... = a_{(n+1)1} = 0$\n",
